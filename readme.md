# Helsinki City Bike Data Explorer

This project focuses on processing and analyzing city bike trip data for eventual visualization in a `Tableau` or `Power BI` dashboard. We handle `data extraction`, `transformation`, and `loading (ETL)` from `CSV` files into a `PostgreSQL` database, with a goal to `visualize` insights after pre-processing.

## Project Overview

1. **Data Source**: CSV files containing city bike trips from `April to October` for the years `2021-2023`.
2. **Data Cleaning and ETL**: Python script for data cleaning and bulk insertion into a PostgreSQL database.
3. **Station Locations**: Station metadata, including geographic coordinates, collected from the [HSL Open Data Portal](https://www.avoindata.fi/data/en_GB/organization/helsingin-seudun-liikenne?vocab_keywords_en=city+bikes) provided by Helsingin seudun liikenne (HSL).
4. **Final Dashboard**: Data will be visualized in a `Tableau` or `Power BI` dashboard after pre-processing with Python.

## Requirements

- **Python 3.7+**
- **PostgreSQL**
- **Python Libraries**: Install required packages:
  
  ```bash
  pip install -r requirements.txt
  ```

## Database Schema

The PostgreSQL database includes a table `city_bike_trips` with the following schema:

```SQL
CREATE TABLE city_bike_trips (
    id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
    departure TIMESTAMP NOT NULL,
    return TIMESTAMP NOT NULL,
    departure_station_id INTEGER NOT NULL,
    departure_station_name VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
    return_station_id INTEGER NOT NULL,
    return_station_name VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
    covered_distance FLOAT NOT NULL,
    duration INTEGER NOT NULL
);
```

A new table `Station` has been added to the database to store station metadata, including geographic coordinates, for integration with `Tableau` and easier linking to `city_bike_trips`.

```SQL
CREATE TABLE Station (
    id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY,
    name VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
    city VARCHAR(100) NOT NULL,
    latitude FLOAT NOT NULL,
    longitude FLOAT NOT NULL
);
```

### Schema Details

`city_bike_trips` Table:

- `departure and return`: Timestamps for trip start and end
- `departure_station_id`, `return_station_id`: IDs of the departure and return stations
- `departure_station_name`, `return_station_name`: Names of the departure and return stations
- `covered_distance`: Trip distance in meters
- `duration`: Trip duration in seconds

`Station` Table:

- `id`: Unique station ID, matches with `departure_station_id` and `return_station_id` in the `city_bike_trips` table.
- `name`: Station name.
- `city`: City where the station is located (Helsinki, Espoo, Vantaa).
- `latitude` and `longitude`: Geographic coordinates of the station.

## Python ETL Script

The Python script reads and cleans each CSV file, then loads it into the PostgreSQL database in bulk. The script includes logging, error handling, and checkpointing to allow resuming from the last processed file in case of interruption.

### Configuration

1. **Database URI**: Replace with your database credentials in the script:

```python
DATABASE_URI = 'postgresql://username:password@localhost:5432/your_database'
```

2. **Data Folder**: Specify the folder path containing the CSV files:

```python
data_folder = 'data/'
```

### Script Usage

Run the script to process and load data into PostgreSQL:

```bash
python insert_data_script.py
```

#### Script Features

- Data Cleaning: Converts timestamps and removes rows with missing critical values.
- Bulk Insertion: Uses pandas.to_sql for efficient insertion with SQLAlchemy.
- Logging: Logs steps and errors to data_import.log.
- Checkpointing: Creates a .checkpoint file after each successful file, allowing restarts from the last processed file.

## Logging and Error Handling

The script logs each step to `data_import.log`, including:

- File processing start and end
- Data cleaning steps
- Bulk insertion success and errors

If a failure occurs, the script stops and can resume from the last unprocessed file due to checkpoint files.

## Station Metadata Integration

The station names and their geographic coordinates were collected from the [HSL Open Data Portal](https://www.avoindata.fi/data/en_GB/organization/helsingin-seudun-liikenne?vocab_keywords_en=city+bikes) provided by Helsingin seudun liikenne (HSL). This data ensures accurate geolocation for all distinct stations in Helsinki, Espoo, and Vantaa.

A Python script has been created to process these station details from the CSV files (`Helsingin_ja_Espoon.csv` and `Vantaan.csv`) and insert them into the Station table in the database.

### Python Script for Station Table

The script reads station data from the provided CSV files, extracts relevant columns (`ID`, `Name`, `City`, `x`, `y`), and populates the `Station` table.

#### Script Usage

Run the script to populate the `Station` table:

```bash
python populate_stations.py
```

#### Script Features

- Reads station data from multiple CSV files.
- Processes and maps columns to database fields.
- Inserts records into the Station table with ON CONFLICT handling for duplicate IDs.

## Final Dashboard

After completing data pre-processing, the data will be visualized in a Tableau or Power BI dashboard, providing insights into city bike trip patterns. The dashboard will leverage PostgreSQL as the data source to explore trends, station popularity, trip durations, and distances over time.

## Data Clarification

The Originâ€“Destination (OD) data of city bike stations includes all journeys made by city bikes in Helsinki and Espoo. The data provides comprehensive details about each trip, including:

- Origin and destination station
- Start and end times
- Distance traveled (in meters)
- Duration of each journey (in seconds)

Data is available from the 2016 season onward and can be accessed by month (as CSV files) or for the entire season (as ZIP files). The data is owned by City Bike Finland.

The station metadata includes latitude and longitude information for all stations in Helsinki, Espoo, and Vantaa.
